# ✨ Wishlist Board

This is a small board for wishes that don’t like being rushed. You come here, write a name, leave a wish, and let it go. Nothing urgent happens after that. The wish doesn’t promise anything, doesn’t make noise, and doesn’t try to impress anyone.

Once your wish is sent, it simply floats around with the others. Slowly, quietly, and without pressure. Maybe it will come true, maybe it won’t. Either way, it’s already doing what it’s meant to do: existing peacefully for a moment.
